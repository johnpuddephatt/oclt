<h5 id="planning-reform-the-impact-on-meeting-oxfords-housing-need"><strong>Planning Reform: The impact on meeting Oxford’s housing need</strong></h5>

<h5 id="push-online-film-showing"><strong>PUSH Online Film Showing</strong></h5>

<p>Participants had the opportunity to watch the award-winning <a href="http://www.pushthefilm.com/">PUSH documentary</a> from director Fredrik Gertten, investigating why we can’t afford to live in our own cities anymore. If you missed it you can <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/127740203387">still watch it here</a>.</p>

<h5 id="why-cant-we-afford-to-live-in-oxford"><strong>Why can’t we afford to live in Oxford?</strong></h5>

<p>In our follow-up event to our online film showing of PUSH, we brought campaign groups and land right organisations Oxfordshire Community Land Trust, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/oxfordagainstschwarzman/">Oxford Against Schwarzman</a> and <a href="https://oxfordtenantsunion.com/">Oxford Tenant’s Union</a> together to reflect on the issues raised by the film and how this relates to housing in Oxfordshire.<br />

<h5 id="boats--coops-what-if-moorings-were-community-owned"><strong>Boats &amp; Coops: What if moorings were community-owned?</strong></h5>

<p>At this event we asked - could more affordable, cooperative residential moorings be the answer to Oxford’s housing crisis? We heard from <a href="https://www.surge.coop/">Surge Cooperative</a>, a group aiming to create community-led moorings for larger boats in East London, and Mark Simmonds from <a href="https://www.culture.coop/">Coop Culture</a>, who supported a boaters coop in Calderdale to set up. Co-hosted with the <a href="https://collaborativehousing.org.uk/">Collaborative Housing Hub</a>.<br />
