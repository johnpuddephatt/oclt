I"[<p>We were delighted to see some of you at a lively launch event for Community Led Housing. About 120 people gathered in Assembly Rooms at Town Hall on a cold winter evening in January. We were welcomed by Charlie Fisher on behalf of the three sponsors, Oxfordshire Community Land Trust, Oxford City Council and the Collaborative Housing Hub.</p>
