I"o<p>By becoming a “Supporter”, and giving a regular or one-off donation, you can help us to continue our pioneering work.</p>

<p>OCLT will eventually have a small income from rents. That will take some time and until then, we remain a small, mostly voluntarily-run organisation we rely on grants and generous donations to maintain our year-to-year operational costs.</p>

<p>We know that many people feel powerless in the face of the extreme housing need and lack of affordability. One way for you to change that is to <a href="https://app.donorfy.com/form/J7EEWBHW62/Q58RQ">support OCLT</a>. This will allow us to shift the narrative about land ownership and move closer to the creation of a parallel community-owned and led system of permanently affordable housing in Oxfordshire.</p>
