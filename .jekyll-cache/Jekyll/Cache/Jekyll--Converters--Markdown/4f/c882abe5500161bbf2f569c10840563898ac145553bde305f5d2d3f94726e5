I"‚<p>In March 2017, Oxford City Council received Â£54,859 from the Community Housing Fund to support the promotion and delivery of more community-led housing.</p>

<p>Oxford City Council commissioned the <a href="http://collaborativehousing.org.uk">Collaborative Housing Hub</a>, which is a partnership between Community First Oxfordshire, Oxfordshire Community Foundation and Oxfordshire Community Land Trust, to undertake a research project to explore how community housing could be delivered sustainably within Oxford City. The methods used for this study included a combination of desk research, a needs assessment, interviews, outreach events and financial assessment.</p>

<p>There are viable models which will work in Oxfordâ€™s urban fabric from small scale (shared co-operative houses and tiny windfall sites) to large partnership development where citizen-leadership can bring distinct benefits.</p>

<p>Some key recommendations from the report:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Develop a strategy to enable genuinely affordable community-led approaches in Oxford and promote community-led housing within the Oxfordshire Growth Board and Joint Statutory Spatial Plan.</li>
  <li>Apply to the Community Housing Fund (grant) to provide enabling support within the council for community-led housing schemes that are currently being proposed by groups in Oxford.</li>
  <li>Include support for community-led housing in the Local Plan, housing and tenancy strategies, appoint a Councillor as Oxfordâ€™s community-led housing champion, and require larger sites to include a proportion of community-led housing through Section 106 agreements.</li>
  <li>Set up a revolving loan fund that community-led housing groups can access for cheaper finance.</li>
</ul>

<p>The outreach for this study showed that very few people know about community-led housing solutions despite having many benefits which struck a chord with interviewees and focus groups including genuine affordability in perpetuity, individual well-being and supportive neighbourhoods.</p>
