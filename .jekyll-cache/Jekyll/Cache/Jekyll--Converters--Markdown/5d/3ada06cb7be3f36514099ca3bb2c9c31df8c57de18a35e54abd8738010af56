I"S<p><strong>OCLT held a webinar exploring access and ownership of land for food production in December 2020 with Good Food Oxford &amp; CAG Oxfordshire.</strong></p>

<p>The affordability and access to agricultural land is a huge barrier to creating sustainable food systems.</p>

<p>The online webinar looked at the issue of land in Oxfordshire and explored how community-owned and cooperative models could enable farmers and growers to meet the county’s food needs.</p>
