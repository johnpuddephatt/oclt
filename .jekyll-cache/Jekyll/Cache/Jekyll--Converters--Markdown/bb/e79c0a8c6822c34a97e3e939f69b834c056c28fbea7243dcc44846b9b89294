I"Í<p><strong>First new build community-led housing development</strong></p>

<p>Recently OCLT submitted plans to Vale of White Horse DC for eight flats on a small site in Dean Court Botley. Earlier this year OCLT finally bought the site after a long wrangle with the Charity Commission. OCLT received sizable donations from two local philanthropists, enough to employ a project manager (John Bloxsom).</p>

<p>This has made a huge difference and now we are moving along! John has not only secured a grant of Â£67,000 from the Community Housing Fund for the Dean Court project but has also worked with Vale officers to secure a further grant of Â£156,000 from the same fund towards the cost of opening up the site through a service road and utility connections, money that has to be spent by February 2020.</p>

<p>So the tenacity has paid off!</p>

<p><strong>Community Share Offer</strong></p>

<p>OCLT is also working on plans for a Community Share Offer with a launch some time later in the year. This is exciting and a fantastic way for the local community to be directly supportive of the work whilst still getting a modest return.</p>

<p>The Share Offer will initially be linked to the Dean Court project but could also be linked to other future projects that are in the pipeline.</p>

<p>OCLT is working closely with Ethex who will host the share offer.</p>

<p><strong>Membership of OCLT</strong></p>

<p>Even if you donâ€™t want to or canâ€™t invest there is still a crucial way you can support and help build the Community-Led Housing sector, become a member of OCLT by <a href="https://www.oclt.org.uk/invest/">signing up here</a>.</p>

<p>Help us recruit other like-minded people who might be interested in making more community-led housing happen. We need to create a network of members across all communities and neighbourhoods within the county both big and small with a view to being able to develop over time, further small developments of genuinely and permanently affordable homes for local people.</p>

<p><strong>The Collaborative Housing Hub</strong></p>

<p>We have been part of the team to secure money to set up a Community Led Housing advice and support centre based in Oxford but operating across Oxfordshire, Berkshire and Buckinghamshire (Thames Valley).</p>

<p>The purpose is to support and develop community-led groups across the county. There are quite a few such groups of intrepid people at very early stages and some have already applied to the Community Housing Fund,a government fund of Â£163m to provide grants to groups.</p>

<p>If you have an interest in starting such a group (for yourself or for others in housing need) then please <a href="https://collaborativehousing.org.uk/contact">get in touch with them directly</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have legal or finance experience and a desire to help OCLT develop?</strong></p>

<p>We are looking for two new Board Members, one with an accounting and finance background and one with a legal/property background. Commitment would be two hour Board Meetings once a month on the third Monday (at our office in Makespace) plus reading associated papers and generally keeping up with developments in Community-led Housing.</p>

<p>If this whets your appetite then get in touch with <a href="https://www.oclt.org.uk/contact/">Fran Ryan</a></p>

<p>Watch out for our next newsletter which will announce OCLTâ€™s 2019 AGM in September</p>
