<p>Taking inspiration from Amsterdam, Freiburg, and other innovative developments in the UK, Homes for Oxford offered a vision worthy of the city of dreaming spires: a new neighbourhood that would have been beautiful, equitable and sustainable.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/wolvercote_image_1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We aimed to secure this key site for homes for local people that will be genuinely affordable in perpetuity, alongside market housing - all configured to promote green lifestyles and neighbourly support. We believe this proposal offered a good financial return to the University of Oxford and unparalleled social value to Wolvercote and the wider community.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/may/31/build-affordable-homes-oxford-land-trust-value">The Guardian article</a> read:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There is massive local support for this proposal: Homes for Oxford received pledges of donations and investments of more than £500,000 in the five days prior to bidding.”</p>

<p>We worked in conjunction with the charity Bioregional to make a highly innovative and sustainable bid for the Wolvercote Paper Mill (WPM) site. ​HfO intended to build at least 190 mixed tenure homes with at least half to be permanently affordable. In addition, we intended to build a further 70 intermediate market permanently affordable homes for key workers (subject to planning). All the homes would have been built in clusters to ensure neighbourliness and mutual support, each having a variety of mixed tenure leasehold homes. The site would have been largely pedestrianised with cars kept to a minimum (significantly less than 1 per household) and parked on the edges of the site.  There would have been office space and a regular bus service. Once the homes were built the land would have been transferred to and managed by a Community Land Trust. The Land Trust will be run by a mix of residents, local villagers and others with professional expertise.</p>

<p>There was massive support for this proposal back in 2016 from local people in the village and the city. Deborah Glass Woodin, of Homes for Oxford <a href="http://24dash.com/news/housing/2016-05-25-Community-groups-tackle-Oxford-s-housing-problems">on 24dash.com said</a>:</p>

  <p>“This is an historic opportunity for the university to do something unprecedented in the country […] Together we can address some of the challenging problems of our time with innovative housing solutions.”</p>
