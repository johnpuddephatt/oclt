<p>The affordability and access to agricultural land is a huge barrier to creating sustainable food systems.</p>

<p>This online webinar looks at the issue of land in Oxfordshire and explores how community-owned and cooperative models could enable farmers and growers to meet the countyâ€™s food needs.</p>

<p>We will hear from research and experiences framing the local context and learn from models from across the UK that could be replicated here. Presentations include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://goodfoodoxford.org/">Good Food Oxford</a> - presenting the findings of their research project</li>
  <li><a href="https://cultivateoxford.org/">Cultivate</a> - giving their first-hand perspective as an Oxford based cooperative</li>
  <li><a href="https://ecologicalland.coop/">The Ecological Land Coop</a> - presenting their model of cooperatively owned farms</li>
  <li><a href="https://tamargrowlocal.org/">Tamar Grow Local</a> - presenting their unique Farm Start model supporting new farmers to access land</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be a optional session from 20.00 - 20.30 for participants to stay and discuss the ideas in small break out groups.</p>
