On Thursday last week we held the opening of Crofts Court. It was a truly momentous occasion, celebrating our first affordable housing development in Oxfordshire. After 15 years of hard work we were delighted to welcome new tenants, investors, stakeholders and friends to the site to look round the building.

We couldn't have done it without you!
