A CLT organisation is set up by a local group of people who get together to do something to ensure there are more affordable assets for that community. These could be for housing, workspace, food production or leisure.

There are various legal mechanisms which can underpin this. OCLT is a Community Benefit Society under the Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014.
