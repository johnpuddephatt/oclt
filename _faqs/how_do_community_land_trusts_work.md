A CLT organisation is set up by a local group of people who get together to do something to ensure there are more affordable assets for that community. These could be for housing, workspace, food production or leisure.

There are various legal mechanisms which can underpin this. OCLT is an Industrial and Provident Society for the Benefit of the Community.
