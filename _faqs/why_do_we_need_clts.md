title: Why do we need community land trusts?
---

One of the biggest needs, especially in this time of post-recession, is to provide land for affordable housing. Increasing numbers of working people find it difficult or impossible to find a secure and affordable place to live. There is also a great shortage of social housing and many working families have no access to them.

CLTs offer a way to provide permanently affordable land (it is permanently owned by the community so doesnâ€™t keep going up in value) for housing and other local needs.
