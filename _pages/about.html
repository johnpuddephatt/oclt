    <p>We are a Community Benefit Society registered in 2006 and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority with charitable status.</p>

<p>OCLT has a strong board and excellent governance arrangements. Most recently, because of the now exceedingly difficult funding environment for affordable homes with no capital grant available, we are working closely with potential partners to create a new fund to receive donations for permanently affordable homes in Oxfordshire.</p>
