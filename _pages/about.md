We are a Community Benefit Society registered in 2006 and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority with charitable status.

OCLT has a strong board and excellent governance arrangements (see our [governing document here](https://app.forestry.io/sites/pybyray5gshxow/body-media//uploads/copy-of-governing-document.pdf)). Most recently, because of the now exceedingly difficult funding environment for affordable homes with no capital grant available, we are working closely with potential partners to create a new fund to receive donations for permanently affordable homes in Oxfordshire.
