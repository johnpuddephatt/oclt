[Oxfordshire Community Land Trust](http://oclt.org.uk/content/information) (OCLT) is a charity which was set up in 2006 to build genuinely-affordable homes and enable community land-ownership across the county.

A number of recent funding successes and exciting shifts in the community housing sector has put us in state of transition as we look to move to the next stage in our organisational development and as a result we have a range of voluntary Non-executive Director positions that have opened up for applications.

New Directors would play an important role in building and implementing our new strategic direction and the time-requirement would be one evening meeting in Oxford on third Monday of each month.

Prospective Directors will be voted in by the membership at the AGM in September 2019 and we can take applications up to the end of July.

If you would like a conversation about the roles or for an application pack please [contact us](https://www.oclt.org.uk/contact/)
