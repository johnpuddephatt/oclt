subtitle: The Community Land Trust Network has just published its latest Report ‘State
  of the Community Land Trust Sector 2023’.
---

The report was launched by the Secretary of State Michael Gove MP in Parliament, who said "What could be a better example than a neighbourhood taking control, then being in charge of its destiny and making sure that the homes in which people live have the heart and soul of that community embedded in the bricks and mortar? That’s why I’m a supporter of CLTs."  
  
The report finds that industry partnerships could help communities to build at least 278,000 homes through replicable project types.

It is estimated that 80% of these homes would be additional and only made possible due to the involvement of a CLT.

In the section on Partnership Products: CLT allocation in a major developer-led site, we were pleased to see that it mentions Bayswater in South Oxfordshire (new CLT to be established, with Christ Church College as landowner and developer to be confirmed).
