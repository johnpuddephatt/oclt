title: Share Offer – Crofts Court
subtitle: Become a Community Investor and Bring New Affordable Homes to Oxfordshire!

---
**Our Community Share Offer launched on 2 November 2022.**

**UPDATE: Update April 19th 2023** 

The Crofts Court Share Offer is now closed. 

We are delighted to announce that we raised over £580,000! This is above the minimum milestone that we hoped to reach. 

**A huge thank you to everyone that invested.** 

We've been overwhelmed by the response and the number of people who want to support our work and take a stake in our first development which brings community-owned permanently affordable homes to Oxfordshire.

If you missed out of the opportunity to invest in the share offer, but would still like to support OCLT financially you can do so by becoming a [supporter](https://app.donorfy.com/form/J7EEWBHW62/Q58RQ "supporter"). As a supporter you can make a one-off or monthly payment to support OCLT's on-going work.

**The problem we're addressing**

There is currently a housing crisis in Oxfordshire. The city is ranked the second least affordable city in Britain. Oxford's affordability ratio is 15.3, meaning that average house prices are 15.3 times that of average salaries. Amongst other factors this has been fuelled by over 900 houses in the city being second homes (nearly 3,000 in the county) alongside a surge in the number of holiday lets.

This is not good enough for the workers who sustain our city!

Our approach is to provide sustainable and genuinely affordable housing using a community land trust model meaning that housing remains affordable in perpetuity and available to those in need. It also means greater involvement and ownership in decision making by those who live there.

**Crofts Court progress**

Our construction of our first development, Crofts Court (eight co-operatively managed apartments at affordable rents for people in the Dean Court area of West Oxford in Cumnor Parish), is well underway.  Our social investors who have taken a stake in the scheme, will help us to support fairer and more sustainable housing in Oxfordshire whilst earning a return on their investment.

We're really excited about our new tenants from the Vale of White Horse's Housing Register moving in by June 2023. [Find out more about our development at Crofts Court](https://www.oclt.org.uk/projects/crofts-court/).
