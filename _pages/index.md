subheading: Our Crofts Court Community Share Offer has now reached its minimum goal
  to raise Â£500,000.  An outstanding result. And with two days to spare. The Board
  is delighted to see that so many people want to participate in spite of such difficult
  times for so many.  We know many more want to invest so we have decided to extend
  the offer period to April 12th as noted in the Crofts Court Business Plan.
