We are currently preparing to raise community shares in our company off the back of our first project in West Oxford. We aim to launch this invesment window in Autumn 2019.

For now there are two ways that you can get involved

**Become a member**

We are currently owned by a group of around 100 people from across the county of Oxfordshire. We want to get this to 1,000 people in the next five years. Be one of our valued early adopters for just Â£1.
