**OCLT Co-ordinator**

Join us and help build a community-led model of affordable housing in the city and beyond. You will be at the centre of growing our membership and developing the organisation. You will work primarily with the Board to make this happen, but will also engage with local stakeholders.

You will be responsible for internal communications and ensuring the OCLT Board is functioning effectively. This will require you to be confident in initiating, coordinating and implementing appropriate procedures and take responsibility for specific projects and tasks.

At first the focus of the work will be administrative. However, by working efficiently and getting on top of this, the role will develop into a more outward facing, entrepreneurial one - you will engage in community organising, build partnerships and immerse yourself in the dynamic local arena of community-led housing.

We’re looking for someone with talent and energy to take on this role. You will need an efficient work ethic to get things done and manage the day to day running of the organisation. Alongside this you will be innovative and use your initiative to identify challenges and act upon opportunities for the organisation. Having a pioneering spirit would be an advantage.

We welcome applicants from all backgrounds - experience in community-led housing is not necessary.
