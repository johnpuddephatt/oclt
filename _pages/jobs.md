### **Treasurer - Voluntary**

Do you want to help create a more affordable and environmentally sustainable approach to housing? Do you want to use your skills to change the way that land is owned and developed in Oxfordshire? 

**We are inviting applications to join the Oxfordshire Community Land Trust Board as our voluntary Treasurer.**

OCLT was set up in 2006 to build a community-led housing sector, secure pockets of land and deliver much needed permanently affordable housing. Find out more about OCLT [here](https://www.oclt.org.uk/).

We are at an **exciting stage of our development** with our first [housing project in Dean Court](https://www.oclt.org.uk/projects/dean-court-oxford/) due to commence this year and another in the early stages of feasibility. We expect to grow at pace over the next few years and we are pioneering innovative ways of developing homes including custom and self-build, co-operative housing, as well as developing partnerships with existing housing providers.

We are looking for a highly organised, motivated and incisive individual with **experience in accounting and financial management** to undertake a central treasury role for a period of at least two years.

There will be an opportunity to further develop and refine our existing finance systems, maintaining an overview of management and reporting and **work creatively with the board to develop finance strategy**.

You will be part of a skilled and motivated Board of [10 members](https://www.oclt.org.uk/about/) coming from various complementary backgrounds including social housing, property development, HR, project finance and law.

If you have any questions about the role, please contact us and we would be happy to arrange a phone conversation.

To apply please read the full [role description here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XcnyMfMoQuI0I3w3aicdo-5JlkfaH3pV/view?usp=sharing) and send a CV and covering letter to [info@oclt.org.uk](mailto:info@oclt.org.uk). There is no closing date as we will review applications on submission and be in touch, but expect to formally appoint at the September AGM.
