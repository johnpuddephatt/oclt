We are currently preparing to raise finance through issuing community shares in the trust off the back of our first project in West Oxford and a pipeline of new projects in the works. We aim to launch this investment window in 2020.

For now there are three ways that you can get involved

### Become a member

We are currently owned by a group of around 100 people from across the county of Oxfordshire. We want to get this to 1,000 people in the next five years. Be one of our valued early adopters for just Â£1. With this share you have a vote in the way we do things.

### Donate

As a small charity we maintain our year-to-year operations through the support of members and funding bodies. A one-off donation allows us to keep shifting the narratives on land.
