## Become a member

As a Community Benefit Society, we are proud to be owned by our members. We are currently owned by a group of over 100 people from across the county of Oxfordshire.

As a member you can have a say and support OCLT through attending and voting at our Annual General Meeting (AGM), as well as standing for election to the board of directors. We also welcome members to get more involved in the organisation through volunteering your time.

Membership is open to any individual 18 or over or any organisation. To become a member you buy a £1 share which entitles you to a single vote in the company. The £1 is the limit of personal liability. <br> <br> <a class="button btn" href="https://app.donorfy.com/form/J7EEWBHW62/53NSK">Become a member</a>
