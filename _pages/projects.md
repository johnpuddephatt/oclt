## Crofts Court

Oxfordshire CLT has completed the development of eight affordable homes for rent in a high value area with an acute shortage of affordable housing. Read more on the project page [here](/projects/crofts-court/).

## Blackbird Leys sites

Oxfordshire CLT, Transition by Design and Oxford City Council are working together to identify brownfield sites – like disused council garages – that could be reclaimed for new homes. Read more on the project page [here](/projects/blackbird-leys-sites/).

## Champion Way

Oxford City Council (OCC) developed a partnership with Oxfordshire Community Land Trust (OCLT) and Transition by Design (TBD), a local design collective, to develop a pilot affordable, community-led housing project on underused urban land.

## Irving Building

We worked with the local community to put in a bid for the Irving Building. The much-loved Victorian school building was owned by Cowley St John Parochial Church Council, a local educational charity. It was in full use until July 2015 for forms one to three of St Mary and St John Primary School. In July 2015 the building was closed and in September 2015, these forms joined the rest of the school, at another nearby site on Meadow Lane. Read more on the project page [here](/projects/irving/).

## Wolvercote Paper Mill

Taking inspiration from Amsterdam, Freiburg, and other innovative developments in the UK, Homes for Oxford offered a vision worthy of the city of dreaming spires: a new neighbourhood that would have been beautiful, equitable and sustainable.
