By becoming a “Supporter”, and giving a regular or one-off donation, you can help us to continue our pioneering work.

OCLT will eventually have a small income from rents. That will take some time and until then, we remain a small, mostly voluntarily-run organisation we rely on grants and generous donations to maintain our year-to-year operational costs.

We know that many people feel powerless in the face of the extreme housing need and lack of affordability. One way for you to change that is to [support OCLT](https://app.donorfy.com/form/J7EEWBHW62/Q58RQ). This will allow us to shift the narrative about land ownership and move closer to the creation of a parallel community-owned and led system of permanently affordable housing in Oxfordshire.

## Be a regular "Supporter"

We appreciate (and in the short term will rely on) the security that regular donations provide.
