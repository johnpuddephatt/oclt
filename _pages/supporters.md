## Sophi

> "I work 60 hours a week most weeks....I am currently on the Council's Housing List... I'm told I'm not a priority and that I should move to Swindon.... I can't do that because I care for my disabled grandmother... I saved up enough for a 10% deposit for a flat but was told that since I'm on minimum wage I wouldn't be able to borrow enough".

## Rachel

**"...to prevent people from being homeless, that's massive. We need more places like that..... if that succeeded and that really worked, there would be more built..... There just needs to be more places for people, there shouldn't be homeless people, not in 2022."**

## Karen

**"I was evicted from my place about two years ago. I became homeless in Oxford.... When you're on the streets, you are lonely and you don't know many people to trust.... Everybody needs help with something, you know if you can just start with 8 and build it up... the waiting lists are very long"**
