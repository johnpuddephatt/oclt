> "I work 60 hours a week most weeks....I am currently on the Council's Housing List... I'm told I'm not a priority and that I should move to Swindon.... I can't do that because I care for my disabled grandmother... I saved up enough for a 10% deposit for a flat but was told that since I'm on minimum wage I wouldn't be able to borrow enough".
