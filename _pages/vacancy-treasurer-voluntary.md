Oxfordshire Community Land Trust (OCLT) is looking for a highly-organised, motivated and incisive accountant to undertake a central role in moving the CLT to the next stage of development. We need someone who can focus on our financial systems and compliance as well as our financing structure and strategy.

You will be part of an experienced Board of 11 members coming from various complementary backgrounds including social housing, property development, HR, project finance and law, and will be supported by our bookkeeper, external firm of accountants and our staff team as we recruit. You will have the opportunity to shape our existing financial systems (we currently use Xero, Senta and Float) and reports as we grow.

The role involves attending evening Board Meetings which are held monthly on the third Monday from 6-9pm in Oxford; chairing the Finance and Development Committee which currently meets on the first Tuesday (but this could be rescheduled to suit the new Treasurer), preparing and presenting reports on our finances, overseeing our account keeping and, at this early stage in our life, being responsible for payments and collections.

Oxfordshire Community Land Trust (OCLT) will go on site early in 2020 with its first build project for 8 permanently affordable flats for local people in housing need. And a second project has just been announced ([link](https://www.oxford.gov.uk/news/article/1241/city_council_to_provide_land_to_pilot_community-led_housing_project_in_oxford)). The Board is working to create a portfolio of community-led and owned land and housing projects across the city and county. Each project will involve the acquisition of property, development arrangements and require grants/borrowing from public or private sources. OCLT has support from relevant agencies and local councils to progress its goals.

OCLT is registered as a Community Benefit Society with the Financial Conduct Authority and is in the process of registering as a social housing provider with the Regulator of Social Housing. Our finances need to be appropriately compliant. We are a membership organisation, with a Board to oversee activities. The Board operates with a Senior Management Team and a Finance and Development Committee. We expect to comply with the NHF Code of Governance.
