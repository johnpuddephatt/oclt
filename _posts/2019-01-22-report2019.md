In March 2017, Oxford City Council received £54,859 from the Community Housing Fund to support the promotion and delivery of more community-led housing. Oxford City Council commissioned the [Collaborative Housing Hub](COLLABORATIVEHOUSING.ORG.UK), which is a partnership between Community First Oxfordshire, Oxfordshire Community Foundation and Oxfordshire Community Land Trust, to undertake a research project to explore how community housing could be delivered sustainably within Oxford City. The methods used for this study included a combination of desk research, a needs assessment, interviews, outreach events and financial assessment.

There are viable models which will work in Oxford's urban fabric from small scale (shared co-operative houses and tiny windfall sites) to large partnership development where citizen-leadership can bring distinct benefits.

Some key recommendations from the report:

* Develop a strategy to enable genuinely affordable community-led approaches in Oxford and promote community-led housing within the Oxfordshire Growth Board and Joint Statutory Spatial Plan.
* Apply to the Community Housing Fund (grant) to provide enabling support within the council for community-led housing schemes that are currently being proposed by groups in Oxford.
* Include support for community-led housing in the Local Plan, housing and tenancy strategies, appoint a Councillor as Oxford’s community-led housing champion require larger sites to include some community-led housing through Section 106 agreements;
* Set up a revolving loan fund that community-led housing groups can access for cheaper finance.

The outreach for this study showed that very few people know about community-led housing. However community-led housing solutions have many benefits that strike a chord with people including genuine affordability in perpetuity, individual well-being and supportive neighbourhoods.
