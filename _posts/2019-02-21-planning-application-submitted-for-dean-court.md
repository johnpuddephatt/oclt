We’re delighted to say we have now submitted our planning application for the new flats in Dean Court (Reference Number P19/V0424/FUL).

Details can be found at:  
http://www.whitehorsedc.gov.uk/java/support/Main.jsp?MODULE=ApplicationDetails&REF=P19/V0424/FUL

Please let us know if you have any questions about this.  Comments can also be made to the District Council. It’s a very exciting moment for us as we finally look forward to the next stage.

And it’s also time to start finding prospective tenants. Do you know anyone who might be interested?

People who are interested in living here must:

* Be registered with www.whitehorsehomechoice.org.uk
* Must have a strong local connection
* Must have a housing need
* Must be interested in cooperating with other tenants to help run the project as effectively as possible*

If you know anyone who meets these criteria ask them to make sure that they are registered.

\* full training and support will be given to tenants to do this. Details will be developed in collaboration with the successful tenants. It could involve co-running the car share scheme, ensuring the grounds and shared spaces are well looked after, or making sure the shared bins are put out. Please note that it is not expected that tenants would undertake repairs or rent collection.
