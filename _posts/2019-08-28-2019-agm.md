Our 2019 Annual General Meeting will be held at [Makespace Oxford](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Makespace+Oxford,+1+Aristotle+Ln,+Oxford+OX2+6TP/@51.7678439,-1.2695815,14z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4876c5289f7ffc31:0x6ffe5c7df19aa5b) (Aristotle Lane) on 30th September 2019 between 7-9pm.

This is an exciting time for OCLT. We are transitioning to having a real project on the ground which shows how, by extracting land from the open market and holding it in trust, we can provide permanently and genuinely affordable homes for local people, thus building genuine community.  
  
Sustainability is the name of the game: social, environmental and financial. We plan to use this project to demonstrate the power of this community-owned and led model in the belief that there are many people out there, landowners AND local people in housing need, who will wish to join us in growing the sector over the next ten years.  
  
We have pipeline of future projects and potential new partners which will help with this transition.   
  
So come and join usâ€¦we welcome existing and new members. Help us grow this alternative model of housing provision in order to ensure the continued security of our city and county.
