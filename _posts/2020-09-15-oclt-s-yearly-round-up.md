We were excited to share our plans for the year ahead. Fran, our Secretary, outlined our aspiration to secure funding to develop the Champion Way project and we showed a film featuring Andy Edwards from Transition By Design giving a sneak peak at what the site and housing might be like. Alice, the Coordinator presented plans for launching an event series and a "supporter" membership scheme in Autumn.

We are also pleased to announce that Dr Sue Brownhill and Deborah Glass-Woodin have bee re-elected to the board and we are welcoming a new board member, Piotr Smok, who will be bringing his wealth of financial experience.
