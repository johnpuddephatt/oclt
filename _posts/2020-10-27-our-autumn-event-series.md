Over the Autumn 2020, OCLT have put on a series of online events looking at land rights, housing issues and community-owned solutions. You can watch the recordings and check out the slides if you missed them below...

**Planning Reform: The impact on meeting Oxford's housing need**

This webinar explored what the Government's "Planning The Future" White Paper will mean for community-led and affordable housing in Oxford with: Professor Sue Brownill (OCLT & Oxford Brookes University), Councillor Alex Hollingsworth (Oxford City Council) & Peter Thompson (Oxford Civic Society).

**PUSH Online Film Showing**  
Participants had the opportunity to watch the award-winning [PUSH documentary](http://www.pushthefilm.com/) from director Fredrik Gertten, investigating why we canâ€™t afford to live in our own cities anymore. If you missed it you can [still watch it here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/127740203387).

**Why can't we afford to live in Oxford?**  
In our follow-up event to our online film showing of PUSH, we brought campaign groups and land right organisations Oxfordshire Community Land Trust, [Oxford Against Schwarzman](https://www.facebook.com/oxfordagainstschwarzman/) and [Oxford Tenant's Union](https://oxfordtenantsunion.com/) together to reflect on the issues raised by the film and how this relates to housing in Oxfordshire.

**Boats & Coops: What if moorings were community-owned?**  
At this event we asked - could more affordable, cooperative residential moorings be the answer to Oxford's housing crisis? We heard from [Surge Cooperative](https://www.surge.coop/), a group aiming to create community-led moorings for larger boats in East London, and Mark Simmonds from [Coop Culture](https://www.culture.coop/), who supported a boaters coop in Calderdale to set up. Co-hosted with the [Collaborative Housing Hub](https://collaborativehousing.org.uk/).
