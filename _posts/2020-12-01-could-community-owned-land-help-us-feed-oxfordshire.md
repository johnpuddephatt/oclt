**OCLT are organising a webinar exploring access and ownership of land for food production hosted by Oxfordshire Community Land Trust and Good Food Oxford**

_9 December 2020 @ 19:00 – 20:30 on Zoom_

[Book tickets here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/could-community-owned-land-help-us-feed-oxfordshire-tickets-128624261629)

The affordability and access to agricultural land is a huge barrier to creating sustainable food systems.

This online webinar looks at the issue of land in Oxfordshire and explores how community-owned and cooperative models could enable farmers and growers to meet the county’s food needs.

We will hear from research and experiences framing the local context and learn from models from across the UK that could be replicated here. Presentations include:

* [Good Food Oxford](https://goodfoodoxford.org/) - presenting the findings of their research project
* [Cultivate](https://cultivateoxford.org/) - giving their first-hand perspective as an Oxford based cooperative
* [The Ecological Land Coop](https://ecologicalland.coop/) - presenting their model of cooperatively owned farms
* [Tamar Grow Local](https://tamargrowlocal.org/) - presenting their unique Farm Start model supporting new farmers to access land

There will be a optional session from 20.00 - 20.30 for participants to stay and discuss the ideas in small break out groups.

Hosted by [Oxfordshire Community Land Trust ](https://www.oclt.org.uk/)with Good Food Oxford and [CAG Oxfordshire](https://cagoxfordshire.org.uk/)
