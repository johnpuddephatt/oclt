**OCLT held a webinar exploring access and ownership of land for food production in December 2020 with Good Food Oxford & CAG Oxfordshire.**

The affordability and access to agricultural land is a huge barrier to creating sustainable food systems.

The online webinar looked at the issue of land in Oxfordshire and explored how community-owned and cooperative models could enable farmers and growers to meet the countyâ€™s food needs.

We heard from research and experiences framing the local context and learn from models from across the UK that could be replicated here. Presentations included:

* [Good Food Oxford](https://goodfoodoxford.org/) - presenting the findings of their research project - see the full report here
* [Cultivate](https://cultivateoxford.org/) - giving their first-hand perspective as an Oxford based cooperative
* [The Ecological Land Coop](https://ecologicalland.coop/) - presenting their model of cooperatively owned farms - see their presentation slides here
* [Tamar Grow Local](https://tamargrowlocal.org/) - presenting their unique Farm Start model supporting new farmers to access land - see their presentation slides here
