**OCLT held a webinar exploring access and ownership of land for food production in December 2020 with Good Food Oxford & CAG Oxfordshire.**

The affordability and access to agricultural land is a huge barrier to creating sustainable food systems.

The online webinar looked at the issue of land in Oxfordshire and explored how community-owned and cooperative models could enable farmers and growers to meet the countyâ€™s food needs.
