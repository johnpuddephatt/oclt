**Moorings Research**

OCLT is supporting an important piece of research by the [Collaborative Housing Hub](https://collaborativehousing.org.uk/) to produce and present Oxford City Council with a proposal for community owned and/or managed residential moorings in the city.

The team is interested to hear from boaters, who live on the river or canal in and around the city, about their needs and whether there is appetite for a community-led approach. [Read more about our research and what community-led moorings are here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cTHxFXb1HqvJoU1iDEQiMl-_OdMRgHOTAoO9zPAbr4c/edit).

Help build a case for community-led moorings by [filling in the survey here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdY1ftp6fdipj0N1B3jAC14TXOKdD0Hd7CIWFRQRCB5gIxLxA/viewform). **Please submit by 25th August**. All respondents will be entered into a prize draw for a £30 voucher for [Sovereign Wharf chandlery](https://sovereignwharf.co.uk/chandlery/).  
We ask our members to spread the word to anyone linked to the boating community.
