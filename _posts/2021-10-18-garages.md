Drop in event at Blackbird Leys Community Centre, Jack Argent Room

**Saturday 30th October 11-2pm**

_Tea, Coffee and food from The Damascus Rose Kitchen_

### **Could disused garages provide space for new affordable homes?**

The Oxford Community Land Trust was set up to create **permanently affordable housing** that is owned by its community.

The Oxfordshire Community Land Trust, Transition by Design and Oxford City Council are working together to identify **disused or underused pieces of brownfield land** such as garage sites owned by City Council that could be repurposed for housing.

Some of the sites being suggested are in your neighbourhood in Blackbird Leys.

**We want to hear from local people** what they’d like to see there - whether it’s housing or other community facilities:

→ Help us look at potential sites

→ Share information about the needs in your area

→ Give feedback about the type of housing or community facilities you’d like to see

Take part in the event
