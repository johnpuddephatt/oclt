##### **Exciting news... Oxfordshire Community Land Trust awarded Registered Provider status!**

##### **But now we need your help more than ever...**

OCLT is delighted to announce that we have been awarded Registered Provider status. This means OCLT is officially a private **Registered Provider of Affordable Housing**. This is an especially great achievement for a small organisation like OCLT. 

This means that we can finally draw down the funding awarded earlier in the year for the [8 affordable apartments in Dean Court](https://www.oclt.org.uk/projects/dean-court-oxford/) from the Vale of White Horse District Council and the Oxfordshire Housing and Growth Deal. OCLT acquired the site in April 2019 and obtained planning consent in April 2020 to build five 1-bed flats and three 2-bed flats, for affordable rent, in perpetuity.

We plan to **start construction on site in 2022**.

The flats will **provide much needed homes** to people on the Vale of White Horse District Councilâ€™s Housing Register. Preference will be given to people with a connection to the local area, Dean Court, Cumnor Parish and the immediately adjacent parishes in VWHDC. Residents will manage the flats as a co-operative. Applicants for the homes will be made through White Horse Homechoice. Those interested in living in one of our homes should make sure they are registered.

OCLT is run by volunteers. **We need your help** to continue see this project through and pursue other exciting projects in the city and beyond, creating community-owned genuinely affordable housing. Once OCLT has a large enough portfolio, it will be able to fund its own office support.

You can help or be part of this innovative and sustainable approach to housing by [joining us](https://www.oclt.org.uk/join/) as a member, and/or [becoming a supporter by giving a monthly amount](https://www.oclt.org.uk/support-us/). No donation too small! Never has the need been greater!

We are also always interested in off market purchase of land and housing for the ultimate provision of permanently affordable homes.
