We are so pleased to be able to tell you that the **Crofts Court build is about to start**!

We have **signed the funding agreements** with the Vale of White Horse District Council, secured private finance, and entered into a Building Contract to construct eight apartments for affordable rent in Dean Court, Botley. Hooray!

Works will start on site soon and are programmed to complete in 2023. OCLT’s objective is that these dwellings  will be available for affordable rent in perpetuity.

The flats will provide **much needed homes to people on the Vale of White Horse District Council’s Housing Register**. Preference will be given to people with a connection to the local area, Dean Court, Cumnor Parish and the immediately adjacent parishes in VWHDC. It is intended that residents will manage the flats as a co-operative.

Allocation of the homes will be made through [White Horse Homechoice](https://www.whitehorsehomechoice.org.uk/). Those interested in living in one of our homes should make sure they are registered with Vale as the flats will be advertised through Homechoice.

As you all know, OCLT is run by volunteers. It will continue to depend on the generosity of grant funders and donors until we have a big enough portfolio of permanently affordable homes to generate a small income to support an office.

Some of you already support is with a regular monthly donation. If others of you can afford **a small amount each month that would be most welcome**. [Become a supporter](https://app.donorfy.com/form/J7EEWBHW62/Q58RQ).
