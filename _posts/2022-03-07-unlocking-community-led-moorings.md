Last year, with support from OCLT, the [Collaborative Housing Hub](https://collaborativehousing.org.uk/) commissioned a report into the idea of community-led moorings in Oxford.   
  
In an unaffordable housing market, secure and well-managed **moorings can provide an affordable housing solution for some**.  
  
This report identifies a **need for more permanent and temporary mooring sites** in the city as well as better facilities for boaters such as access to water and waste disposal. There is growing movement of boaters' cooperatives across the country and an acknowledgement of the benefits of the moorings being owned or managed by the boating community.

Collaborative Housing are holding an online event on **Wednesday 16th March (19:00 - 20:30)** to discuss the findings of the report and the next steps to join up local boaters interested in community-led options and deliver on the recommendations in the report.
