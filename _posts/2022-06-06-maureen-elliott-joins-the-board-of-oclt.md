We are excited to announce the appointment of Maureen Elliott to the Board of Directors. Maureen has had a career in local government in both Ireland and England and has worked across a wide range of services in both countries. Her experience is mainly, but not exclusively, in finance. She is a qualified accountant and member of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy.

She has recently stood down from the board of Oxfordshire Community and Voluntary Association after nine years in the role of treasurer.

We also would like to express our deepest gratitude to our former Director Chris Bright who for several years worked tirelessly to help OCLT reach its current position of starting construction on its first site of affordable rented homes. Chris has had to step down due to his existing commitments, but we will forever be grateful for his significant contribution.
