OCLT Board Members recently visited its Dean Court site as LIFE Build Solutions Ltd, its appointed contractor, mobilises its equipment and site team for the beginning of the construction phase.

The construction phase for the 8 affordable rent apartments is likely to be complete by the end of May 2023. However, we will be busy in the meantime setting up the co-operative that will run the building, and training and selecting those future tenants who will join that co-operative.

The apartments will provide much needed homes to people on the Vale of White Horse District Council’s Housing Register. Preference will be given to people with a connection to the local area, Dean Court, Cumnor Parish and the immediately adjacent parishes in VWHDC.

At the end of the autumn we plan to launch a Community Share Offer that will provide investors with the opportunity to support these much needed affordable rented homes.

The development would not have been possible without funding and support from the Vale of White Horse District Council, Oxfordshire Growth Board, Homes England, Low Carbon Hub, the Ecology Building Society, the Community Housing Fund Revenue Programme 2021/22 (funded by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities), and members of the public who have become members of OCLT.
