Oxfordshire Community Land Trust is delighted to tell you that in May this year building started on its development of apartments now called Crofts Court. They are due to be ready for the first residents in June 2023.  There will be 3 x two bed (3 person) flats, 3 x 1 bed (2 person) flats and 2 x1 bed (1 person) flats.

The apartments will be rented at no more than the Local Housing Allowance and if you’re interested and you can meet the following requirements then watch out on the Vale of White Horse Homechoice website for when the project is advertised.  Meanwhile please get in touch and let us know of your interest.

1\.	First you must be registered on Vale of White Horse Housing Register. [https://www.whitehorsehomechoice.org.uk.](https://www.whitehorsehomechoice.org.uk. "https://www.whitehorsehomechoice.org.uk.")

2\.	A local connection is required. Local connection will need to be evidenced of:

o	having lived in Cumnor Parish for a period of not less than 5 years within the last eight years and is currently a resident of Cumnor Parish; or

o	having previously lived in Cumnor Parish for at least five years and their parents or children still live there and have done so for at least ten years; or

o	having worked full time for two years in Cumnor Parish or the equivalent part-time and there is evidence of a continuing commitment to work in Cumnor Parish;

o	If there are not sufficient people who meet the above local connection, the test will then be applied to the parishes of Appleton with Eaton, Besselsleigh, North Hinksey, South Hinksey, Sunningwell, Wootton, and Wytham, and if there is still insufficient people, anyone on the Vale’s housing waiting list firstly in Cumnor Parish, then the above parishes, and finally anyone within the Vale’s District.

3\.	Third, the apartments will be managed as a housing co-operative. Training meetings about this aspect of the project will start in early 2023 and consideration will only be given to people who have attended these meetings and demonstrated preparedness to work with fellow tenants on the project.

No one can be considered for a tenancy without meeting all of the above criteria.
