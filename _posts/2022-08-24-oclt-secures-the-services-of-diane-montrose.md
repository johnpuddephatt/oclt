We're delighted to announce that Diane Montrose of DiddyRox Marketing has agreed to provide Social Media consultancy services to OCLT.

Diane has a number of local Oxfordshire clients, an extensive network of media contacts and brings invaluable skills across a variety of Social Media platforms.

When hearing about our needs in Social Media, Diane was very keen to assist given the real difference that our Crofts Court development will make to local people's lives.

Here at OCLT, we're very excited to see Diane increase the effectiveness of our Social Media platforms on Facebook, Twitter and Linkedin, especially in time for our Community Share Offer launch in October.
