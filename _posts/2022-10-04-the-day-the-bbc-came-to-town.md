We were very excited to welcome BBC reporter Jessica Banham to our site at Deans Court, Botley last week, as we ran as the lead story on Wednesday evening's BBC South East news. 

You can read the story [here](https://oclt.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=705f7de83867afe997c4f8eba&id=4f43d68ea5&e=d09c64a6ed), and for anyone who missed the episode, catch up on the video [here](https://oclt.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=705f7de83867afe997c4f8eba&id=8ae4814806&e=d09c64a6ed).  
   
This all goes to show how pressing the cost of living and housing crises are, and that community led housing is starting to make in-roads into the public consciousness as a viable alternative approach to affordable housing.  
   
Community led housing is all about people like you and the support you give us.  
   
Stay tuned for our community share offer launch later this month!
