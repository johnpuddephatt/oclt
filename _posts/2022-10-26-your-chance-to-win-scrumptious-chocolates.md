**COMMUNITY SHARE OFFER COMING SOON!!   
  
HELP INCREASE OUR SOCIAL MEDIA FOLLOWERS AND HAVE A CHANCE TO WIN SOME SCRUMPTIOUS CHOCOLATES!!**

We're getting ready to launch our Community Share Offer on November 2nd. This is going to be vital in supporting the successful completion of our 8 new affordable community led homes for local people in housing need in west Oxford.  
  
In spite of generous grant funding from both Vale of White Horse and the Oxfordshire Futures Partnership the development still needed a mortgage from Ecology Building Society; and the ever increasing variable interest rate now risks the projectâ€™s successful delivery so we're raising community funds to replace some of the Ecology mortgage on more affordable terms.  
  
A successful Community Share Offer relies on great publicity and to that end we're asking all of our supporters to follow us on Facebook, Twitter and/ or Linkedin. **To sweeten the request, we're running a competition with the CHANCE TO WIN some exquisite chocolates on each of our social media channels if ten or more of your contacts follow us before Sunday 6 November 2022**.
