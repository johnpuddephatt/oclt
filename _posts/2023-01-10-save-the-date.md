**SAVE THE DATE!**

We're arranging a special event with Aspire, which does such great work to tackle homelessness in the county. We'll be having guest speakers, updates on both organisations' work, a deep dive into our community share offer, and of course the chance to network whilst enjoying refreshments.

We're fortunate to be able to host our event at Trinity College, so please mark our event in your diary and more details will be on the way soon. As there will be limited capacity, we will be running an RSVP requirement. To register your initial interest please email info@oclt.org.uk

**WEDNESDAY 15TH FEBRUARY 6PM TO 8PM, TRINITY COLLEGE, OXFORD**
