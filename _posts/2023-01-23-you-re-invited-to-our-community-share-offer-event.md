Come and join us for an evening with **guest speakers including Jan Royall (Principal of Somerville and Co-Chair of Oxford Inclusive Economic Partnership), and short films**.

We've already raised 58% of our £500,000 target to be able to protect this first development from rising interest rates and to scale up this unique model.

Come and learn how you can **get involved and help**. Oxfordshire is continuing to experience an **affordable housing crisis**, and we're determined to start to make a real difference. **JOIN US!**

**We will be delighted to:**

• tell you in person and share photographs of our construction progress at Crofts Court

• explain to you how community-led housing works

• explain what our Community Share Offer is and **WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP**

• share short videos of some local people in housing need

• introduce you to our supporters so that you can network and **enjoy refreshments together**

2\. W e are hosting this event **in conjunction with Aspire Oxfordshire** - Come and learn about their efforts over the past year to help **those affected by homelessness** in the county.

Aspire have a number of housing projects in Oxfordshire to support the **critical lack of suitable move-on housing** for people affected by homelessness and rough sleeping. Aspire also works with housing associations and other partners to provide innovative responses to Oxfordshire's housing and homelessness crisis including a **homelessness prevention service**, delivering a countywide **'Housing First' service** and expanding its social lettings service with private landlords. This is alongside **employment development and social inclusion support**. They also encourage collaboration, helping to initiate the Oxfordshire Homeless Movement.
