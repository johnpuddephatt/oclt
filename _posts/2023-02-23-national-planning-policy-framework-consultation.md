The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) is open for consultation until 2nd March 2023. After much lobbying from the Community Land Trust Network, we're pleased to see that a number of questions relating to community led development have been posed in [Chapter 5](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/levelling-up-and-regeneration-bill-reforms-to-national-planning-policy/levelling-up-and-regeneration-bill-reforms-to-national-planning-policy). However, the [draft tracked changed NPPF](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1126647/NPPF_July_2021_-_showing_proposed_changes.pdf) at new paragraph 80 has practically no provision for our sector. **Therefore it's important that as many of you as possible request support from the NPPF for community led development before 2nd March.**  
  
This is one of the most significant planning policy opportunities for community led development. Along with government funding, it's one of the most important enabling factors that can grow the sector. The new NPPF could potentially take some of the most progressive local plan policy examples out there and require other authorities to adopt a similarly supportive policy position, but the government is unlikely to do this without pressure. Don't delay, send in your consultation now!
