Crofts Court Community Share Offer is now closed!

Oxfordshire Community Land Trust is delighted to announce that it has raised in excess of Â£580,000, after making the decision back in February to extend the closing date deadline for the Crofts Court Community Share Offer. 
 
Thank you to everyone that has invested.

We've been overwhelmed by the number of people who want to support our work, and take a stake in our first development, which brings community-owned, permanently affordable homes to Oxfordshire. This investment means that we can now further significantly reduce the trust's reliance on borrowing. Not only did extending the deadline help us raise even more funds, but it will also see our membership rise by 150, which is amazing! 

Work at Crofts Court is going full steam ahead. Kitchens and bathrooms have been fitted and utilities are being connected. It's very exciting! Interviews and training are taking place over the next few weeks. We will keep you updated on when the first tenants are expected to move in. 

Thank you again to all our members and shareholders.
