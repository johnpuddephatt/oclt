We are currently working flat out recruiting the first tenants of the Crofts Court Housing Coop. On May 13th, we were pleased to welcome everyone to whom we have provisionally offered a place, to meet with Blase Lambert (Chair of the [Confederation of Cooperative Housing](https://www.cch.coop/our-staff/)). It was an informative and motivational session. All those who attended are full of energy and positivity to make this whole enterprise work. The homes will be managed by the people who reside in them through a tenant management cooperative.
