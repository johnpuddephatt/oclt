Oxfordshire Community Land Trust (OCLT) is delighted to advertise a 3-bedroom house for let at an affordable rent in St Clement’s Ward, East Oxford. The property is in a quiet 1990s cul-de-sac just a 20-minute walk from central Oxford, and close to both South Park and Cowley Road.

We are looking for a small family (1 or 2 adults plus 1 or 2 children under 10) to move in from the beginning of March 2024.

Downstairs, the property has a kitchen, lounge with double doors opening onto a garden, a WC, and an under-stairs utility cupboard. Upstairs, it has a large double bedroom with an en-suite bathroom, a separate bathroom, and two small upstairs bedrooms. The two small bedrooms are relatively small and so only qualify as “half” bedrooms according to Local Authority’s standards. As such they’re only suitable for children under 10 years old.

The house will be let at Local Housing Allowance – currently £912.50 per month, and likely to rise to £1125 from April onwards.

If you wish to apply to rent this house, you must meet the following criteria:

* be a member of OCLT (you can [sign up here](https://app.donorfy.com/form/J7EEWBHW62/53NSK) for just £1)
* have at least one and no more than two children under 10 years of age
* be in housing need 
* have a connection to the local area

For more details on what these criteria involve, please see our application form.
