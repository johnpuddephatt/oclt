We know that many people feel powerless in the face of the extreme housing need and lack of affordability in our city and county. The pandemic and all the inequalities laid bare by it, have underlined the critical need to create more affordable and decent homes. Community Land Trusts (CLTs) are part of the solution to this and your local CLT needs you right now.

**How you can help**

You can become a member of OCLT for just £1. As a member you will receive regular updates about our work and have the chance to influence the future work of OCLT through attending AGMs and voting on major decisions. You’ll also be invited to other events for example celebratory events when we start on site. You’ll also have the chance to look at an comment on our plans before they’re finalised.

To get to the next stage we also aim to raise a total of £12,000 to take us to March 2022. This is simply to cover essentials such as membership of our professional body [NCLT,](http://www.communitylandtrusts.org.uk/) insurance, bookkeeping, and on line communication costs. We would love you to become a supporter member and make a regular small or large donation. Any amount will help. So please…
