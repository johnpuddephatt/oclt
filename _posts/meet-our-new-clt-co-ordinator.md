**Introducing Graham Burgess**

Graham has just joined the team as OCLT Co-ordinator. He has a varied background, including a physics degree, a spell in the Department for Transport and an internship with an Intellectual Property Consultancy based in Oxford. He's just returned from a solo bicycle tour from the UK to Japan. Graham has volunteered on several homelessness projects in the South East, including co-running a campaign to help homeless people to vote in the 2017 UK General Election. Graham is new to the community-led housing arena but brings plenty of energy to help push this work forwards.
