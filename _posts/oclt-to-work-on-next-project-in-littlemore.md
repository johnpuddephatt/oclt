Earlier this year local architecture practice Transition by Design, who are national leaders in talking about, designing and researching issues around citizen-led housing, came to OCLT with a proposal.

TbD had pitched to Oxford City Council to prototype a form of co-operative affordable housing on tiny sites using off-site manufacturing techniques, a first for the city and an idea which was proposed in the Oxford Routes to Delivery Report (2018). TbD would get the funding if Oxford City could help them find a site and, if it all worked out, Oxfordshire CLT would be in line to take on the long-term lease. It was an exciting project with lots of potential.

A few months later TbD had secured money from the [Community Housing Fund](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/community-housing-fund) to get planning permission for homes on a small garage site in Littlemore, and so the team began working on the designs. Since then OCLT has received monthly updates at our Board Meetings and continue to encourage progress.

On Wednesday 13th November the proposal went to [Oxford City Council's Cabinet](http://mycouncil.oxford.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=527&MId=5333&Ver=4) to make the decision on transferring a long lease at nil cost to a community group, with the intention of that organisation being Oxfordshire CLT but not locked into being so.

Having worked with Transition by Design on the Wolvercote Paper Mill and Irving Building projects, we are very happy to be partnering with them once again.
