Oxfordshire CLT has completed the development of eight affordable homes for rent in a high value area with an acute shortage of affordable housing. The homes are situated on the edge of the City of Oxford in the administrative area of Cumnor Parish Council and the Vale of White Horse District Council.

Rents have been set at levels comparable with the Local Housing Allowance for the Oxford BRMA. The development consists of five one bedroom and three two-bedroom flats. The design seeks to achieve high levels of energy efficiency including PV solar for each apartment in order to promote sustainability and minimise energy bills for residents. The site is a ‘backland’ development located between existing housing in a mixed tenure area. This is a sustainable location serviced by regular and fast public transport connections to and from Oxford City Centre. We intend to operate a car club for the use of tenants and have provided bike racks.

Full planning permission was granted on 8 April 2020, and our contractor Lifebuild Solutions Limited completed the development in June 2023. Lettings are from the local Housing Register, subject to an agreed local lettings policy that prioritises people with a local connection, and a requirement that applicants are willing to join a tenant co-operative.
