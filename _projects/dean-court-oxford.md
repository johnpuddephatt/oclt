Oxfordshire CLT is planning to build eight affordable homes for rent in a high value area with an acute shortage of affordable housing on the edge of the City of Oxford and in the administrative area of Cumnor Parish Council and the Vale of White Horse District Council.

The intention is to set rents at levels comparable with the Local Housing Allowance for the Oxford BRMA. The development will consist of a mix of one bedroom and two-bedroom flats built to Nationally Described Space Standards. The design seeks to achieve high levels of insulation, near PassivHaus standard, in order to promote sustainability and minimise energy bills for residents. The site is a 'backland' development located between existing housing in a mixed tenure area. This is a sustainable location serviced by regular and fast public transport connections to and from Oxford City Centre. We will operate a car club for the use of tenants and provide bike racks.

The land is accessed through an unmade service area which connects to Eynsham Road (B4044) in the ownership of Vale of White Horse District Council. We have agreed Heads of Terms for an enduring easement in order to build on our site and for its occupants to have access. We have made a request that the local authority seek capital infrastructure funding to make up and connect the access area to the highway under Community Housing Fund Phase One.

The site had planning consent for six units P14/V0625/FUL granted on 25 September 2014. This design will be replaced by a new eight-unit design. Pre-application enquiries and pre-application consultation have been undertaken in June 2018 with the Parish Council and local residents. The recent planning history of the site, together with our enquiries and consultations, gives us confidence that the new application will be approved. Lettings will be from the local Housing Register, subject to an agreed local lettings policy, and a requirement that applicants are willing to join a tenant co-operative.
