&lt;p&gt;Graham has just joined the team as OCLT Co-ordinator. He has a varied background, including a physics degree, a spell in the Department for Transport and an internship with an Intellectual Property Consultancy based in Oxford. He’s just returned from a solo bicycle tour from the UK to Japan. Graham has volunteered on several homelessness projects in the South East, including co-running a campaign to help homeless people to vote in the 2017 UK General Election. Graham is new to the community-led housing arena but brings plenty of energy to help push this work forwards.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Introducing Graham Burgess</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/uploads/headshot.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Next project: a new model for empty garage sites in Oxford</title><link href="/2019/11/14/oclt-to-work-on-next-project-in-littlemore.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Next project: a new model for empty garage sites in Oxford" /><published>2019-11-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-11-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/2019/11/14/oclt-to-work-on-next-project-in-littlemore</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2019/11/14/oclt-to-work-on-next-project-in-littlemore.html">&lt;p&gt;While OCLT awaits the final planning permission to proceed with Dean Court we are delighted to announce another project which got formal approval from Oxford City Council’s Cabinet last night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year local architecture practice &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.transitionbydesign.org&quot;&gt;Transition by Design&lt;/a&gt; (TbD), who are national leaders in talking about and researching issues around citizen-led housing, came to OCLT with a proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TbD had pitched to Oxford City Council to prototype a form of co-operative affordable housing on tiny sites using off-site manufacturing techniques, a first for the city and an idea which was proposed in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://issuu.com/cohohub/docs/oxfordclh_finalreport_and_appendice/44&quot;&gt;Oxford Routes to Delivery Report&lt;/a&gt; (2018). TbD would put the work in bidding for the funding if Oxford City could help them find a site and, if it all worked out, Oxfordshire CLT would be in line to take on the long-term lease. It was an exciting project with lots of potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oxford City Council proposed a small vacant garage site in Littlemore and supported TbDs bid to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/community-housing-fund&quot;&gt;Community Housing Fund&lt;/a&gt;. Fast-forward to April 2019 and TbD had secured money to get the site to planning permission, and the team began working on the designs. Since then OCLT has received monthly updates at our Board Meetings and continue to contribute ideas and time to the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday 13th November the proposal went to&lt;a href=&quot;http://mycouncil.oxford.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=527&amp;amp;MId=5333&amp;amp;Ver=4&quot;&gt; Oxford City Council’s Cabinet&lt;/a&gt; to make the decision on transferring a long lease at nil cost to a community group, with the intention of that organisation being Oxfordshire CLT but not locked into being so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having worked with Transition by Design on the Wolvercote Paper Mill and Irving Building projects, we are very happy to be partnering with them once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be formally launching both the Routes to Delivery report and announce plans for Community Led Housing in the city and beyond on Thursday 16th January in the Town Hall at 6.30pm with Oxford City Council and the &lt;a href=&quot;collaborativehousing.org.uk&quot;&gt;CoHoHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="champions ways" /><category term=" littlemore" /><category term="empty garages" /><summary type="html">While OCLT awaits the final planning permission to proceed with Dean Court we are delighted to announce another project which got formal approval from Oxford City Council’s Cabinet last night.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/uploads/Annotation%202019-11-12%20152038.png" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Candidates for the OCLT board 2019</title><link href="/2019/09/19/candidates-for-the-oclt-board-2019.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Candidates for the OCLT board 2019" /><published>2019-09-19T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-09-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/2019/09/19/candidates-for-the-oclt-board-2019</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2019/09/19/candidates-for-the-oclt-board-2019.html">&lt;p&gt;We have three terrific potential candidates for election to the board this year.

&lt;p&gt;Bryony Harrington is the Manager of the Right to Build Task Force, a government-supported body dedicated to helping local authorities, landowners and community groups to scale up opportunities for owner-commissioned homes. Bryony joined the Task Force from Graven Hill, the UK’s largest Custom and Self-Build development where she helped coordinate the project through the early stages of its set-up, well into the sales and construction phase. Bryony has always hoped to build a home on her family farm in North Oxfordshire and is an ardent believer in the power of community-led housing and self-build to improve lives. Before Graven Hill she spent seven years in the music industry, travelling the world as a Tour Manager for bands and running a live music production company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;alison-matthias&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alison Matthias&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alison has had a career in housing property development for housing associations. She has 20 years experience including project management of housing development schemes: large scale major repairs and re-improvement programmes, multi-million pound new-build housing development programmes, developing and managing housing for vulnerable people, and developing housing for older people. She has housing management experience for an Inner London local authority. As Development and New Business Director at Oxford Citizens Housing Association she managed development programmes and procured new business. She has project managed stock transfer of a local authority estate to a Registered Provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alison also has twelve years experience in Housing Policy and Strategy at Homes England, managing policy on environmental sustainability and existing homes. She completed a secondment as an Area Manager at HE, managing funding contracts with Registered Providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an exciting time for OCLT. We are transitioning to having a real project on the ground which shows how, by extracting land from the open market and holding it in trust, we can provide permanently and genuinely affordable homes for local people, thus building genuine community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sustainability is the name of the game: social, environmental and financial. We plan to use this project to demonstrate the power of this community-owned and led model in the belief that there are many people out there, landowners AND local people in housing need, who will wish to join us in growing the sector over the next ten years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have pipeline of future projects and potential new partners which will help with this transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So come and join us…we welcome existing and new members. Help us grow this alternative model of housing provision in order to ensure the continued security of our city and county.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The photo above was taken at a recent Board meeting where we were planning strategy to 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently OCLT submitted plans to Vale of White Horse DC for eight flats on a small site in Dean Court Botley. Earlier this year OCLT finally bought the site after a long wrangle with the Charity Commission. OCLT received sizable donations from two local philanthropists, enough to employ a project manager (John Bloxsom).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has made a huge difference and now we are moving along! John has not only secured a grant of £67,000 from the Community Housing Fund for the Dean Court project but has also worked with Vale officers to secure a further grant of £156,000 from the same fund towards the cost of opening up the site through a service road and utility connections, money that has to be spent by February 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the tenacity has paid off!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Untitled-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community Share Offer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OCLT is also working on plans for a Community Share Offer with a launch some time later in the year. This is exciting and a fantastic way for the local community to be directly supportive of the work whilst still getting a modest return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Share Offer will initially be linked to the Dean Court project but could also be linked to other future projects that are in the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OCLT is working closely with Ethex who will host the share offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/20171005_202215.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Membership of OCLT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you don’t want to or can’t invest there is still a crucial way you can support and help build the Community-Led Housing sector, become a member of OCLT by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oclt.org.uk/invest/&quot;&gt;signing up here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help us recruit other like-minded people who might be interested in making more community-led housing happen. We need to create a network of members across all communities and neighbourhoods within the county both big and small with a view to being able to develop over time, further small developments of genuinely and permanently affordable homes for local people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Collaborative Housing Hub&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been part of the team to secure money to set up a Community Led Housing advice and support centre based in Oxford but operating across Oxfordshire, Berkshire and Buckinghamshire (Thames Valley).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose is to support and develop community-led groups across the county. There are quite a few such groups of intrepid people at very early stages and some have already applied to the Community Housing Fund,a government fund of £163m to provide grants to groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have an interest in starting such a group (for yourself or for others in housing need) then please &lt;a href=&quot;https://collaborativehousing.org.uk/contact.html&quot;&gt;get in touch with them directly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have legal or finance experience and a desire to help OCLT develop?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are looking for two new Board Members, one with an accounting and finance background and one with a legal/property background. Commitment would be two hour Board Meetings once a month on the third Monday (at our office in Makespace) plus reading associated papers and generally keeping up with developments in Community-led Housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this whets your appetite then get in touch with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oclt.org.uk/contact/&quot;&gt;Fran Ryan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please let us know if you have any questions about this.  Comments can also be made to the District Council. It’s a very exciting moment for us as we finally look forward to the next stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s also time to start finding prospective tenants. Do you know anyone who might be interested?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who are interested in living here must:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be registered with www.whitehorsehomechoice.org.uk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Must have a strong local connection&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Must have a housing need&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Must be interested in cooperating with other tenants to help run the project as effectively as possible*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know anyone who meets these criteria ask them to make sure that they are registered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* full training and support will be given to tenants to do this. Details will be developed in collaboration with the successful tenants. It could involve co-running the car share scheme, ensuring the grounds and shared spaces are well looked after, or making sure the shared bins are put out. Please note that it is not expected that tenants would undertake repairs or rent collection.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="community land trust" /><category term="dean court" /><category term="co-operative housing oxford" /><category term="community-led housing" /><category term="collaborative housing" /><category term="oxfordshire community land trust" /><summary type="html">We’re delighted to say we have now submitted our planning application for the new flats in Dean Court (Reference Number P19/V0424/FUL).</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/uploads/Untitled-1.png" /></entry><entry><title type="html">January Update</title><link href="/2019/01/25/january-update.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="January Update" /><published>2019-01-25T14:53:20+00:00</published><updated>2019-01-25T14:53:20+00:00</updated><id>/2019/01/25/january-update</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2019/01/25/january-update.html">&lt;p&gt;Belated greetings for 2019.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dean-court-update&quot;&gt;Dean Court Update&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of you will remember what a devastating blow it was when we had to suspend the Dean Court project in March 2015 because we’d hit an unexpected legal issue with the Charity Commission. Back then we had to let go of the almost £1m worth of funding we had assembled, including a hefty grant from the Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the delay has in fact taken a positive guise as we have been able to take advantage of the new Community Housing Fund 2018, a £163m pot for exactly the sort of thing we are doing at Dean Court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November we heard that we’d been successful in being awarded £67,000 by Homes England towards the pre-development work on the Dean Court site&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as the money arrives we will be applying for planning permission for the Dean Court flats. In parallel with preparing new plans we’ve been working with our lawyers to sort out the access to the site which is owned by Vale of White Horse District Council.  We hope this will also be concluded to our mutual satisfaction in the very near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/181114 - FullSlideDeck.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;event-in-february&quot;&gt;Event in February&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know anyone who might be interested in forming a group to ultimately find or create a community-led place in which to live affordably and securely? We’re running a meeting for such people on Tuesday 12th February 6pm (for an hour) at &lt;a href=&quot;http://openhouseoxford.co.uk&quot;&gt;Open House Oxford&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;funding-for-office&quot;&gt;Funding for office&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calling it an office is a bit grand: we have in fact got a hot-desk and we’re there every Tuesday and at other times by arrangement. Just before Christmas, we heard that the Midcounties Co-op will fund our rent at &lt;a href=&quot;http://makespaceoxford.org&quot;&gt;Makespace Oxford&lt;/a&gt; until the end of Feb 2020 so that’s very good news and a welcome boost after the years of running on empty! OCLT board meetings are held here every month&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;updateon-the-hub&quot;&gt;Update on the hub&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OCLT are collaborating with a range of partners to set up a housing hub to promote and develop community-led projects across the Thames Valley. It’s called Collaborative Housing. Next month we will be applying for funding to start supporting groups so &lt;a href=&quot;https://collaborativehousing.us18.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=cad5092a6194557f4e0cd18ba&amp;amp;id=69ef08d93a&quot;&gt;sign up to the mailing list&lt;/a&gt; if you want to keep informed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thanks&quot;&gt;Thanks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally a further big thanks to the donors who made it possible for us to employ the redoubtable John Bloxsom who has been the engine of much of this progress. Thanks again to them but most of all to him. The Homes England money will mean we can fund him for a bit longer so that’s a brilliant result.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Belated greetings for 2019.

&lt;p&gt;Oxford City Council commissioned the &lt;a href=&quot;http://COLLABORATIVEHOUSING.ORG.UK&quot;&gt;Collaborative Housing Hub&lt;/a&gt;, which is a partnership between Community First Oxfordshire, Oxfordshire Community Foundation and Oxfordshire Community Land Trust, to undertake a research project to explore how community housing could be delivered sustainably within Oxford City. The methods used for this study included a combination of desk research, a needs assessment, interviews, outreach events and financial assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are viable models which will work in Oxford’s urban fabric from small scale (shared co-operative houses and tiny windfall sites) to large partnership development where citizen-leadership can bring distinct benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;button&quot; href=&quot;https://issuu.com/cohohub/docs/oxfordclh_finalreport_and_appendice&quot;&gt;Read the full report here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some key recommendations from the report:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Develop a strategy to enable genuinely affordable community-led approaches in Oxford and promote community-led housing within the Oxfordshire Growth Board and Joint Statutory Spatial Plan.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apply to the Community Housing Fund (grant) to provide enabling support within the council for community-led housing schemes that are currently being proposed by groups in Oxford.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Include support for community-led housing in the Local Plan, housing and tenancy strategies, appoint a Councillor as Oxford’s community-led housing champion, and require larger sites to include a proportion of community-led housing through Section 106 agreements.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set up a revolving loan fund that community-led housing groups can access for cheaper finance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outreach for this study showed that very few people know about community-led housing solutions despite having many benefits which struck a chord with interviewees and focus groups including genuine affordability in perpetuity, individual well-being and supportive neighbourhoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The members of the study team were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookes.ac.uk/templates/pages/staff.aspx?uid=p0070247&quot;&gt;Dr Sue Brownill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Fisher_Charlie&quot;&gt;Charlie Fisher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/ron-gibbons-6361a311/&quot;&gt;Ron Gibbons&lt;/a&gt; (Oxfordshire Community Land Trust), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-mcculloch-090a9061/&quot;&gt;Tom McCulloch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/fiona-mullins-82b91a39/&quot;&gt;Fiona Mullins&lt;/a&gt; (Community First Oxfordshire) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaynewoodley/?originalSubdomain=uk&quot;&gt;Jayne Woodley&lt;/a&gt; (Oxfordshire Community Foundation).&lt;/p&gt;

This has been possible due to generous donations by two of our benefactors. Thanks so much to both of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John will work on getting the Dean Court project back on track. He will also be working with our collaborators Community First Oxfordshire to pull together the many community-led housing strands across the county and beyond to form a community-led housing network with a view to securing funding to set up an office with expert staff to drive further development of this sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vision is to build a vibrant and viable citizen-led housing sector of permanently affordable homes, across the county and beyond. There is government support for this (in the form of grants) at the moment and we need to be positioning ourselves to make the most of this opportunity. It won’t solve the housing crisis but over the course of the next 20 years it can make not only a useful but also a creative and locally meaningful contribution to the housing crisis. A community housing sector will make a creative and locally-meaningful contribution to the housing crisis whilst developing our villages, towns and cities into more viable and vibrant entities with homes for young people and those on average salaries.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="news" /><summary type="html">We are pleased to announce the appointment of John Bloxsom to work as a part-time Project Officer with OCLT for at least the next six months.
